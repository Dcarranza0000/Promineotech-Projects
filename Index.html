      <p>
        The Swedish manufacturer’s 5.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 engine is mated to a novel Light Speed gearbox that can handle its prodigious output, which can reach 1,600 hp when running on E85 biofuel. 
        Even more remarkable about the Jesko are its aerodynamics, which in the limited production Jesko Attack model produce more than 3,000 pounds of downforce. 
        Although all 125 examples of the Jesko are currently sold out, we anticipate the standard model should be able to achieve (and likely exceed) Christian von Koenigsegg’s projected top speed for it, which is 278 mph. 
        The fastest, the Jesko Absolut, is claimed to reach 330 mph by tweaking the aerodynamics, reducing drag, and increasing stability. 
        Koenigsegg is expected to make a new speed run with the Jesko Absolut some time this year.

      <p>
        The Bolide is a track-only hypercar that Bugatti claims can reach 311 mph. 
        The Bolide is powered by the same 8.0-liter quad-turbocharged W-16 engine as the Chiron, but it’s been tuned to produce 1,825 hp when running on 110-octane racing fuel. 
        The Bolide is also significantly lighter than the Chiron, weighing in at just 2,734 pounds. 
        Bugatti claims the Bolide can lap the Nürburgring Nordschleife in 5:23.1, which is faster than any production car has ever gone around the Green Hell. 
        Bugatti has not announced how many Bolides it will build, but it has said that the car is a one-off prototype.
